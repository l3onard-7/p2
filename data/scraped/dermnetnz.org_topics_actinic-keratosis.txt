What is an actinic keratosis?
Actinic keratosis
is a
precancerous
scaly
spot found on sun-damaged skin, also known as solar
keratosis.
It may be considered an early form of
cutaneous
squamous cell carcinoma
(a
keratinocyte cancer
).

top on the nasal bridge - a common site for
actinic keratoses

lesion

Who gets actinic keratoses?
Actinic
keratoses
affect people that have often lived in the tropics or subtropics and have predisposing factors such as:
Other signs of
photoageing skin
Fair skin with a history of
sunburn
History of long hours spent outdoors for work or recreation
Defective immune system.
However, even in temperate climates they may be common - in southern Ireland and northwest England up to 25% of people aged 60 years and over have at least one.
What causes actinic keratoses?
Actinic keratoses are the result of abnormal skin cell
development
due to
DNA
damage by short wavelength UVB.
They are more likely to appear if the immune function is poor, due to ageing, recent sun exposure,
predisposing disease,
or certain
drugs
.
What are the clinical features of actinic keratosis?
Actinic keratosis may be solitary but there are often multiple keratoses. The appearance varies.
A flat or thickened
papule
, or
plaque
White or yellow; scaly,
warty
, or horny surface
Skin coloured, red, or
pigmented
Tender or
asymptomatic
They are sometimes graded according to their appearance:
Grade 1: Mild pink or grey marks with slight
scale
and gritty to touch
Grade 2: Moderate thicker
hyperkeratosis
and easily detected
Grade 3: Severe hyperkeratotic thick
keratin
Grade 4:
Confluent
areas several centimetres with a range of the above grades of AK
Actinic keratoses are very common on sites repeatedly exposed to the sun, especially the backs of the hands and the face, most often affecting the ears, nose, cheeks, upper lip, vermilion of the lower lip, temples, forehead, and balding scalp. In severely chronically sun-damaged individuals, they may also be found on the upper trunk, upper and lower limbs, and
dorsum
of feet.

Complications of actinic keratoses
The main concern is that actinic keratoses indicate an increased risk of
developing
cutaneous
squamous cell carcinoma
. It is rare for a solitary actinic keratosis to evolve to
squamous
cell
carcinoma
(SCC), but the risk of SCC occurring at some stage in a patient with more than 10 actinic keratoses is thought to be about 10 to 15%. A tender, thickened, ulcerated, or enlarging actinic keratosis is suspicious of evolution to SCC.
Cutaneous horn
may arise from an underlying actinic keratosis or SCC.
Because they are sun damaged, people with actinic keratoses are also at risk of developing
actinic cheilitis
,
basal cell carcinoma
(BCC, which is more common than SCC),
melanoma,
and rare forms of skin
cancer
such as
Merkel cell carcinoma
.
How is an actinic keratosis diagnosed?
Actinic keratosis is usually easy to diagnose clinically or by
dermoscopy
(see
actinic keratosis dermoscopy
). Occasionally, a
biopsy
is necessary, for example, to exclude
SCC
, or if treatment fails.
What is the treatment for actinic keratoses?
Actinic keratoses are usually removed because they are unsightly or uncomfortable, or because of the risk that skin cancer may
develop
in them. The latter point is a matter of considerable debate, and the most robust studies (Cochrane review) did not find convincing evidence that AK treatment resulted in a prevention of
invasive
squamous cell
carcinomas.
Treatment of an actinic keratosis requires removal of the defective skin cells.
Epidermis
regenerates from surrounding or
follicular
keratinocytes
that have escaped sun damage.
Some AKs will resolve with the frequent and appropriate use of sunscreens.
Tender, thickened, ulcerated, or enlarging actinic keratoses should be treated aggressively. Asymptomatic flat keratoses may not require active treatment but should be kept under observation.
Physical treatments
Physical treatments are used to destroy individual keratoses that are generally symptomatic or have a thick hard surface scale. The
lesions
may
recur
in time, in which case they may be retreated by the same or a different method.
Cryotherapy using liquid nitrogen
Liquid nitrogen
spray
is required to achieve adequate depth and duration of the freeze. This varies according to lesion location, width, and thickness. Healing varies from 5–10 days on the face, 3–4 weeks on the hands, and 6 weeks or longer on the legs. A light freeze for a superficial actinic keratosis usually leaves no mark, but longer freeze times result in
hypopigmentation
or scar.
Shave, curettage and electrocautery
Shave,
curettage
(scraping with a sharp instrument) and
electrocautery
(burning) may be necessary to remove a
cutaneous horn
or
hypertrophic
actinic keratosis. Healing of the wound takes several weeks or longer, depending on the body site. The specimen is sent for
histological
examination.
Excision
Excision
ensures the actinic keratosis has been completely removed, which should be confirmed by
pathology.
The surgical wound is sutured (stitched). The sutures are removed after a few days, the time depending on the size and location of the lesion. The procedure leaves a permanent scar.
Field treatments
Creams
are used to treat areas of sun damage and flat actinic keratoses, sometimes after physical treatments have been carried out. Field treatments are most effective on facial skin. Pretreatment with
keratolytics
(such as
urea
cream
,
salicylic acid
ointment
or
topical retinoid
), and thorough skin cleansing improves response rates. Results are variable and the course of treatment may need repeating from time to time. With the exception of diclofenac
gel
, field treatments all result in local
inflammatory
reactions such as redness, blistering and discomfort for a varying length of time.
Diclofenac
is more often used as an
anti-inflammatory
drug. A special gel
formulation
(3%) in a base containing sodium hyaluronate) is applied twice daily for 3 months, it is fairly well tolerated in the treatment of actinic keratoses, but less effective than the other options listed here.
Piroxicam - similar to diclofenac.
5-Fluorouracil
is a
cytotoxic
agent. The cream formulation is applied once or twice daily for 2 to 8 weeks. Its effect may be enhanced by
calcipotriol
ointment. 5-fluorouracil may be available as a combination product along with
salicylic acid
.
Skin peels using trichloroacetic acid or Jessner
solution.
Imiquimod
cream is an immune response modifier. It is applied 2 or 3 times weekly for 4 to 16 weeks.
Photodynamic therapy
(PDT) involves applying a photosensitiser (a
porphyrin
chemical such as
methyl aminolevulinic acid
) to the affected area prior to exposing it to a source of visible light.
Tirbanibulin
is
a
synthetic
inhibitor
of tubulin polymerisation and
protein
kinase signalling. This 5 day
topical
treatment received a product license in countries such as the USA, UK, and Germany in 2021.
Oral
retinoids
have been used in organ
transplant
recipients and are shown to reduce the risk of SCC development in those with numerous AKs.
Prevention of actinic keratoses
Actinic keratoses are prevented by strict
sun protection
. If already present, actinic keratoses may improve with a very high sun protection factor (50+) broad-spectrum
sunscreen
applied at least daily to affected areas, year-round.
The number and severity of actinic keratoses can also be reduced by taking
nicotinamide
(vitamin B3) 500 mg twice daily.
What is the outlook for actinic keratoses?
Actinic keratoses may recur months or years after treatment. The same treatment can be repeated or another method used. Patients who have been treated for actinic keratoses are at risk of developing new keratoses. They are also at increased risk of other
skin cancers
, especially
intraepidermal squamous cell carcinoma
, invasive cutaneous
squamous cell carcinoma
,
basal cell carcinoma
and
melanoma
.
