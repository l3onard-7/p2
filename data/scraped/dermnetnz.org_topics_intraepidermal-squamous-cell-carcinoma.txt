What is intraepidermal squamous cell carcinoma?
Intraepidermal
squamous
cell
carcinoma
(SCC) is a common superficial form of
keratinocyte cancer
. It is also known as Bowen disease, intraepidermal carcinoma (IEC) and carcinoma
in situ
(SCC in situ).
Intraepidermal SCC is derived from
squamous cells
, the flat
epidermal
cells that make
keratin
, the horny
protein
that makes up skin,
hair
and
nails.
‘Intraepidermal’ and ‘in situ’
mean
the
malignant
cells are confined to the tissue of origin, in this case, the
epidermis.
Who gets intraepidermal squamous cell carcinoma?
Risk factors for intraepidermal SCC include:
Sun exposure: intraepidermal SCC is most often found in sun-damaged individuals.
Arsenic
ingestion
: intraepidermal SCC is common in populations exposed to arsenic.
Ionising radiation: intraepidermal SCC was common on unprotected hands of radiologists early in the 20th century.
Human papillomavirus (HPV)
infection
: this is implicated in intraepidermal SCC on fingers and fingernails.
Immune suppression
due to
disease
(eg
chronic
lymphocytic
leukaemia
) or
medicines
(eg
azathioprine
,
ciclosporin
).
Up to 50% of patients with intraepidermal SCC have other
keratinocytic
skin cancers, mainly
basal cell carcinoma
.
What causes intraepidermal SCC?
Ultraviolet radiation
(
UV
) is the main cause of intraepidermal SCC. It damages the skin cell
nucleic acids
(
DNA
), resulting in a
mutant
clone
of the
gene
p53,
setting off uncontrolled growth of the skin cells. UV also suppresses the immune response, preventing recovery from damage.
Human papillomavirus (HPV) is another major cause of intraepidermal SCC.
Oncogenic
strains of HPV are the main cause of squamous intraepithelial
lesions
(SIL), that is,
squamous cell
carcinoma in situ in
mucosal
tissue.
What are the clinical features of intraepidermal SCC?
Intraepidermal SCC presents as one or more irregular
scaly
plaques
of up to several centimetres in diameter. They are often an orange-red colour but may also be brown.
Although intraepidermal SCC may arise on any area of skin, it is most often diagnosed on sun-exposed sites of the ears, face, hands and lower legs. When there are many plaques,
distribution
is not
symmetrical
(unlike
psoriasis
).

Intraepidermal SCC may start to grow under a
nail
when it results in a red streak (erythronychia) that later may destroy the
nail plate.

Complications of intraepidermal squamous cell carcinoma
Invasive SCC
arises in about 5% of intraepidermal SCC lesions.
How is intraepidermal squamous cell carcinoma diagnosed?
Intraepidermal SCC is often recognised clinically.
Dermatoscopy
of a red scaly irregular
plaque
is supportive if it reveals crops of rounded and coiled
blood vessels.
Diagnosis may be confirmed by
biopsy
;
histology
reveals full thickness
dysplasia
of the epidermis.
What is the treatment for intraepidermal SCC?
As intraepidermal SCC is confined to the surface of the skin, there are various ways to remove it.
Recurrence
rates are high, whatever method is used, particularly in immune suppressed patients.
Observation
As the risk of
invasive
SCC is low, it may not be necessary to remove all lesions, particularly in elderly patients.
Keratolytic
emollients
containing
urea
or
salicylic acid
may be sufficient to improve symptoms.
Excision
Solitary lesions can be cut out, and the defect repaired by stitching it up.
Excision
is often recommended if there is suspicion of invasive SCC.
Superficial skin surgery
Superficial skin surgery refers to shave,
curettage
and
electrosurgery
, and is an excellent choice for solitary or few
hyperkeratotic
lesions. The
lesion
is sliced off or scraped out; then the base is cauterised. Dressings are applied to the open wound to encourage moist wound healing over the next few weeks.
Cryotherapy
Cryotherapy
means removing a lesion by freezing it, usually with liquid nitrogen. Moderately aggressive
cryotherapy
is suitable for multiple, small, flat patches of intraepidermal SCC. It leaves a permanent white mark at the site of treatment.
Fluorouracil cream
5-fluorouracil cream
contains a
cytotoxic
agent and can be applied to multiple lesions. The
cream
may be used for intraepidermal SCC for four weeks and repeated if necessary. It causes a vigorous skin reaction that may ulcerate.
Imiquimod cream
Imiquimod
cream is an immune response modifier used off-licence to treat intraepidermal SCC. It is applied 3–5 times weekly for 4–16 weeks and causes an
inflammatory
reaction.
Photodynamic therapy
Photodynamic therapy
(PDT) refers to treatment with a photosensitiser (a
porphyrin
chemical) that is applied to the affected area before exposing it to a strong source of visible light. The treated area develops an inflammatory reaction and then heals over a couple of weeks or so. The best studied,
methyl levulinate cream PDT
used off licence, provides high cure rates for intraepidermal SCC on the face or lower legs, with excellent cosmetic results. The main disadvantage is the pain experienced by many patients during treatment.
Other treatments
Other treatments occasionally used in the treatment of intraepidermal SCC include:
Combination treatments
Diclofenac gel
Topical retinoid
(tazarotene, tretinoin)
Chemical peel
Radiotherapy
Electron beam therapy
Carbon dioxide
laser
ablation
Erbium:YAG laser
ablation
Oral retinoid
(
acitretin
,
isotretinoin
)
How can intraepidermal SCC be prevented?
Meticulous
sun protection
at any time of life can reduce the number of intraepidermal SCCs and is particularly important for
ageing
, sun-damaged white skin; and in patients that are immune suppressed by disease, for example with
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection
, or by
medications
.
Stay indoors or under the shade in the middle of the day.
Wear
covering clothing
.
Apply high protection SPF50+, broad-spectrum
sunscreens
generously to
exposed skin
if outdoors.
Avoid indoor tanning (
sun beds and solaria
).
What is the outlook for intraepidermal SCC?
Intraepidermal SCC may
recur
months or years after treatment. The same procedure can be repeated or another method used.
Patients that have been treated for intraepidermal SCC are at risk of
developing
new lesions of intraepidermal SCC. They are also at increased risk of other
skin cancers
, especially
squamous cell carcinoma
,
basal cell carcinoma
and
melanoma
.
