Background
Skin cancer
is the most common of all cancers, afflicting perhaps two-thirds of white-skinned New Zealanders and many others throughout the world. Skin
cancer
is also the easiest cancer to cure if diagnosed and treated early. However, if the skin cancer is allowed to
progress
, it can result in disfigurement and even death.
Who should do a self-skin examination?
Everyone should! It is particularly important for people with the following characteristics to do so.
White skin
Aged over 40
Previous
melanoma
Previous
basal cell carcinoma
or
squamous cell carcinoma
Many
moles
or
freckles
Actinic keratoses
(
scaly
spots on sun-exposed sites)
Outdoor work or recreation
Many
sunburns
or visits to
solaria
Syndromes that increase the risk of
skin cancer
Taking
immune suppressive medications
, eg organ
transplant
patients
Skin self-examination can be supplemented by clinical examination by a
dermatologist
or a general practitioner. In many areas of New Zealand and elsewhere, sophisticated photographic screening systems have been established (
mole mapping
). Whole-body digital photographs are recorded, together with close-up and
dermatoscopic
pictures of
lesions
of concern. These are examined by an expert in
dermatoscopy
. Whole-body images reveal new lesions, and digital dermatoscopic surveillance at intervals can reveal subtle changes that may indicate the
development
of
melanoma
within an existing
lesion.
When should I examine my skin?
Skin self-examination should be done often enough to become a habit, but not so often as to feel like a bother. For most people an interval of one to three months is ideal. Photographic screening is generally performed annually.
After the first few times, self-examination should take no longer than a few minutes. You will need help in seeing your back, so enrol your partner or a good friend to help.
What do skin cancers look like?
There are three main types of skin cancer:
Basal cell carcinoma
(BCC)
Squamous cell carcinoma
(SCC)
Melanoma
.
There are many other types of
skin cancer
, but these are rare.
Because each has many different appearances, it is important to know the early warning signs. Look especially for change of any kind. Do not ignore a suspicious spot simply because it does not hurt. Skin cancers may be painless, but dangerous all the same. If you notice one or more of the warning signs, see a doctor right away.
What are the warning signs of skin cancer?
A skin growth that increases in size and appears pearly,
translucent
, tan brown, black, or multicoloured.
A
melanocytic
naevus
(mole),
birthmark
or any skin spot that:
Changes in colour.
Increases in size or thickness
Changes in texture
Is irregular in outline
Is bigger than 6 mm, the size of a pencil eraser
A spot or sore that:
Itches or hurts
Crusts or scabs
Ulcerates or bleeds
Fails to heal within three weeks
In other words, be concerned by a lesion that looks different from your other skin spots. This is sometimes called an ugly duckling—in New Zealand, we often use another term, a black sheep. The good news is that most ugly ducklings turn out to be harmless.
Benign
melanocytic naevus (moles)
,
freckles
and
seborrhoeic keratoses
can be hard to distinguish from skin cancers at times.
What parts of my skin should I check?
Watch our video on self-examination
made in association with
Melanoma New Zealand
, or check out the self-skin examination guide below.
The self-skin examination should start with the head and end with the feet.
The self-skin examination should include the scalp, face, neck, beneath facial
hair
and trunk.
On the upper part of the body, the self-skin examination should include the armpits, hands, finger webs and
nail
beds.
A mirror should be used to examine the back and skin between the buttocks.
On the legs, it should include toe webs, toenail beds and soles of the feet.
Print the body map below to mark the site of any lesions you're concerned about.

When should I see my doctor?
Show your doctor anything that concerns you — the earlier the better. Ask for a full skin check. Like most cancers, the earlier you detect skin cancer the simpler the treatment. Because skin cancer is on the outside of your body it is the easiest cancer to see. So even though skin cancer is the commonest cancer, it is also the most curable. Keep your eyes open for any changes, and take a few sensible precautions.
