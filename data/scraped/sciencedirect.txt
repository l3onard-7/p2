Wide Local Excision
Wide local excision is the primary treatment for cutaneous melanoma. Several studies have looked at what constitutes an adequate margin. For in situ melanoma, a margin of 0.5 cm is indicated, although wider margins may be necessary to achieve histologic clearance of larger melanomas in situ of the lentigo maligna type. For melanomas with a depth of 1 mm or less, 1-cm margins are indicated. For melanomas with a depth 1.01 to 2.0 cm, a margin of either 1 cm or 2 cm is acceptable. For melanomas with a depth of more than 2.0 cm, a margin of 2 cm is indicated. Randomized controlled trial data do not support wider margins for local control of thicker cutaneous melanomas. For invasive primary melanoma, excision should extend to but not include the deep fascia.69

Clinical margins may be difficult to determine with melanoma in situ of the lentigo maligna subtype. Often there is subclinical extension of atypical melanocytes. Different techniques in biopsy and margin control have been proposed to address this issue. These include techniques for staged excision and Mohs micrographic surgery.77-79 Some advocate using topical imiquimod 5% cream to treat these in situ melanomas with indistinct margins in patients who are not surgical candidates, but this therapy has not been subjected to a randomized controlled trial.80
