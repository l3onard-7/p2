Find the right SPF for your family
SPF—or Sun Protection Factor—is a measure of a sunscreen’s abillity to prevent UVB rays from burning the skin.
HOW DOES IT WORK?
SPF ratings are determined in a laboratory setting. For example, SPF 50 products are estimated to allow 1/50 of the sun’s burning rays to get through to the skin (protects against approximately 98% of the sun’s burning rays).
WHICH SPF SHOULD I USE?
It depends on your skin tone! If it takes 20 minutes for your unprotected skin to start turning red, using an SPF 10 should prevent reddening for 15 times longer (about five hours), and SPF 30 should prevent reddening for 30 times longer (about 15 hours).*

Use this chart to choose an SPF based on your skin type and amount of time you plan to spend in the sun on an average day. SPF ratings are determined in a laboratory setting.
SPF 50 products are estimated to allow 1/50 of the sun’s burning rays to get through to the skin (protecting against approximately 98% of the sun’s burning rays).
SPF 100 products are estimated to allow 1/100 of the sun’s burning rays to get through to the skin (protecting against approximately 99% of the sun’s burning rays).
Actual protection may vary and will depend on the user applying adequate amounts of sunscreen. Reapply at least every 2 hours or as directed on the package to help ensure sufficient protection.
