How to reduce your skin cancer risk
Often referred to as our ‘national cancer,’ Australia has one of the highest rates of
skin cancer
in the world. Each year, more than 2000 Australians die from this almost entirely preventable disease.
Fortunately, being SunSmart is a simple and effective way to reduce your risk of developing skin cancer.
Cancer Council provides guidance on how much sun you need and how to protect yourself from getting too much sun exposure. We also offer a range of high quality, affordable
sun protection products
to help keep you safe from the sun's damaging UV rays.
For in-depth information, visit our page on
UV radiation
.
