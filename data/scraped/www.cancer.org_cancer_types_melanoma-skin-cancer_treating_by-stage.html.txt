Treatment of Melanoma Skin Cancer, by Stage
The type of treatment(s) your doctor recommends will depend mainly on the
stage
and location of the melanoma. But other factors can be important as well, such as the risk of the cancer returning after treatment, if the cancer cells have certain gene changes, and your overall health.

Treating stage 0 melanoma
Treating stage I melanoma
Treating stage II melanoma
Treating stage III melanoma
Treating stage IV melanoma
Treating recurrent melanoma
Treating stage 0 melanoma
Stage 0 melanoma (melanoma in situ) has not grown deeper than the top layer of the skin (the epidermis). It is usually treated by
surgery
(wide excision) to remove the melanoma and a small margin of normal skin around it. The removed sample is then sent to a lab to be looked at with a microscope. If cancer cells are seen at the edges of the sample, a second, wider excision of the area may be done.
Some doctors may consider the use of imiquimod cream (Zyclara) or
radiation therapy
after surgery if not all the cancer cells can be removed for some reason, although not all doctors agree with this.
For melanomas in sensitive areas on the face, some doctors may use
Mohs surgery
or even imiquimod cream if surgery might be disfiguring, although not all doctors agree with these uses.
Treating stage I melanoma
Stage I melanomas have grown into deeper layers of the skin, but they haven’t grown beyond the area where they started.
These cancers are typically treated by wide excision (
surgery
to remove the tumor as well as a margin of normal skin around it). The width of the margin depends on the thickness and location of the melanoma. Most often, no other treatment is needed.
Some doctors may recommend a
sentinel lymph node biopsy
(SLNB) to look for cancer in nearby lymph nodes, especially if the melanoma is stage IB or has other traits that make it more likely to have spread. You and your doctor should discuss this option.
If the SLNB does not find cancer cells in the lymph nodes
, then no further treatment is needed, although close
follow-up
is still important.
If cancer cells are found on the SLNB
(which changes the cancer stage to stage III – see below), a lymph node dissection (removal of all lymph nodes near the cancer) might be recommended. Another option might be to watch the lymph nodes closely by getting an imaging test such as
ultrasound
of the nodes every few months.
If the SLNB found cancer, adjuvant (additional) treatment with
immune checkpoint inhibitors
or
targeted therapy drugs
(if the melanoma has a
BRAF
gene mutation) might be recommended to try to lower the chance the melanoma will come back. Other drugs or perhaps vaccines might also be options as part of a
clinical trial
.
Treating stage II melanoma
Stage II melanomas have grown deeper into the skin than stage I melanomas, but they still haven’t grown beyond the area in the skin where they started.
Wide excision (
surgery
to remove the melanoma and a margin of normal skin around it) is the standard treatment for these cancers. The width of the margin depends on the thickness and location of the melanoma.
Because the melanoma may have spread to nearby lymph nodes, many doctors recommend a
sentinel lymph node biopsy
(SLNB) as well. This is an option that you and your doctor should discuss.
If a SLNB is done and does not find cancer cells in the lymph nodes
, then sometimes no further treatment is needed, but close
follow-up
is still important.
For certain stage II melanomas, the
immune checkpoint inhibitor
pembrolizumab (Keytruda) might be given after surgery to help reduce the risk of the cancer returning.
Radiation therapy
to the area might be another option, especially if the melanoma has features that make it more likely to come back.
If the SLNB finds that the sentinel node contains cancer cells
(which changes the cancer stage to stage III – see below), then a lymph node dissection (where all the lymph nodes in that area are surgically removed) might be recommended. Another option might be to watch the lymph nodes closely with an imaging test such as
ultrasound
of the nodes every few months.
Whether or not the lymph nodes are removed, adjuvant (additional) treatment with
immune checkpoint inhibitors
or
targeted therapy drugs
(if the melanoma has a
BRAF
gene mutation) might be recommended to try to lower the chance the melanoma will come back. Other drugs or perhaps vaccines might also be options as well as part of a clinical trial.
Your doctor will discuss the best options with you depending on the details of your situation.
Treating stage III melanoma
These cancers have spread to nearby areas in the skin or lymph vessels, or they have reached the nearby lymph nodes.
Surgical treatment
for stage III melanoma usually requires wide excision of the primary tumor as in earlier stages, along with a lymph node dissection (where all the nearby lymph nodes are surgically removed).
After surgery, (additional) adjuvant treatment with
immune checkpoint inhibitors
or with
targeted therapy drugs
(for cancers with
BRAF
gene changes) may help lower the risk of the melanoma coming back. Other drugs or perhaps vaccines may also be recommended as part of a
clinical trial
to try to reduce the chance the melanoma will come back. Another option is to give
radiation therapy
to the areas where the lymph nodes were removed, especially if many of the nodes contain cancer.
If melanoma tumors are found in nearby lymph vessels in or just under the skin (known as
in-transit tumors
), they are removed, if possible. Other options might include injections of the
T-VEC vaccine (Imlygic), interleukin-2 (IL-2), or Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine
directly into the melanoma; radiation therapy; or applying imiquimod cream. For melanomas on an arm or leg, another option might be isolated limb perfusion or isolated limb infusion (infusing just the limb with
chemotherapy
). Other possible treatments might include
targeted therapy
drugs (for melanomas with a
BRAF
or
C-KIT
gene change),
immunotherapy
, or chemotherapy.
Some stage III melanomas might be hard to cure with current treatments, so taking part in a
clinical trial
of newer treatments might be a good option.
Treating stage IV melanoma
Stage IV melanomas have already spread (metastasized) to other parts of the body, such as distant lymph nodes, areas of skin, or other organs.
Skin tumors or enlarged lymph nodes causing symptoms can often be removed by
surgery
or treated with
radiation therapy
.
If there are only a few metastases
, surgery to remove them might sometimes be an option, depending on where they are and how likely they are to cause symptoms. Metastases that can’t be removed may be treated with radiation or with injections of the
T-VEC vaccine (Imlygic)
directly into the tumors. In either case, this is often followed by adjuvant treatment with medicines such as
immunotherapy
or
targeted therapy
drugs.
The
treatment of widespread melanomas
has changed in recent years as newer forms of immunotherapy and targeted drugs have been shown to be more effective than chemotherapy.
Immunotherapy
drugs called
checkpoint inhibitors
are often the first treatment. These drugs can shrink tumors for long periods of time in some people. Options might include:
Pembrolizumab (Keytruda) or nivolumab (Opdivo) alone
Nivolumab combined with relatlimab (Opdualag)
Nivolumab or pembrolizumab, plus ipilimumab (Yervoy)
Combinations of checkpoint inhibitors seem to be more effective, although they’re also more likely to result in serious side effects, especially if they contain ipilimumab.
People who get any of these drugs need to be watched closely for serious side effects.
In about half of all melanomas, the cancer cells have
BRAF
gene changes
. These melanomas often respond to treatment with
targeted therapy
drugs – typically a combination of a
BRAF
inhibitor and a
MEK
inhibitor. However, the immune checkpoint inhibitors mentioned above are often tried first, as this seems to be more likely to help for longer periods of time. Another option might be a combination of targeted drugs plus the immune checkpoint inhibitor atezolizumab (Tecentriq).
While immunotherapy is often used before targeted therapy, there might be situations where it makes sense to use targeted therapy first. For example, the targeted drugs are more likely to shrink tumors quickly, so they might be preferred in cases where this is important. In either case, if one type of treatment isn’t working, the other can be tried.
A small portion of melanomas have changes in the
C-KIT
gene. These melanomas might be helped by targeted drugs such as imatinib (Gleevec) and nilotinib (Tasigna), although these drugs often stop working eventually.
Rarely, melanomas might have changes in other genes such as
NRAS, ROS1, ALK
, or the
NTRK
genes, which can be treated with targeted drugs.
Immunotherapy
using other medicines might be an option if immune checkpoint inhibitors or other treatments aren’t working. Options might include:
Interleukin-2 (IL-2) (also known as aldesleukin)
Lifileucel (Amtagvi), a type of tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapy
These treatments can cause serious side effects in some people, so they are usually given in the hospital.
Chemotherapy
(chemo) can help some people with stage IV melanoma, but other treatments are usually tried first. Dacarbazine (DTIC) and temozolomide (Temodar) are the chemo drugs used most often, either by themselves or combined with other drugs. Even when chemo shrinks these cancers, the cancer usually starts growing again over time.
It’s important to carefully consider the possible benefits and side effects of any recommended treatment before starting it.
Because stage IV melanoma is often hard to cure with current treatments, people may want to think about taking part in a
clinical trial
. Many studies are now looking at new targeted drugs, immunotherapies, and combinations of different types of treatments. (See
What’s New in Melanoma Skin Cancer Research?
)
Treating recurrent melanoma
Treatment of melanoma that comes back after initial treatment depends on where in the body the melanoma is, what treatments a person has already had, the person’s overall health and preferences, and other factors.
Local recurrence
Melanoma might come back in the skin near the site of the original tumor, sometimes even in the scar from the surgery. In general, these local (skin) recurrences are treated with
surgery
similar to what would be recommended for a primary melanoma. This might include a
sentinel lymph node biopsy
(SLNB). Depending on the results of the SLNB, other treatments might be recommended as well.
In-transit recurrence
If melanoma recurs in nearby lymph vessels in or just under the skin (known as
in-transit recurrence
), it should be removed with surgery, if possible. Other options might include injections of the
T-VEC vaccine (Imlygic), interleukin-2 (IL-2), or Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine
directly into the melanoma;
radiation therapy
; or applying
imiquimod cream
. For melanomas on an arm or leg, another option might be isolated limb perfusion or isolated limb infusion (infusing just the limb with
chemotherapy
). Other treatments might include
targeted therapy
(for melanomas with a
BRAF
or
C-KIT
gene change),
immunotherapy
, or chemotherapy.
Recurrence in nearby lymph nodes
If the nearby lymph nodes weren’t removed during the initial treatment, the melanoma might come back in these lymph nodes. Lymph node recurrence is typically treated by
lymph node dissection
if it can be done, sometimes followed by adjuvant (additional) treatments such as
radiation therapy
and/or
immunotherapy
or
targeted therapy
(for cancers with
BRAF
gene changes). If surgery is not an option, radiation therapy or systemic treatment (immunotherapy, targeted therapy, or chemo) can be used.
Recurrence in other parts of the body
Melanoma might also come back in distant parts of the body. Almost any organ can be affected. Most often, the melanoma comes back in the lungs, bones, liver, or brain. Treatment for these recurrences is generally the same as for stage IV melanoma (see above). Melanomas that recur on an arm or leg may be treated with isolated limb perfusion/infusion
chemotherapy
.
Melanoma that comes back in the brain can be hard to treat. Single tumors can sometimes be removed by
surgery
.
Radiation therapy
to the brain (stereotactic radiosurgery or whole-brain radiation therapy) may help as well. Systemic treatments (
immunotherapy
,
targeted therapy
, or chemo) might also be options.
As with other stages of melanoma, people with recurrent melanoma may want to think about taking part in a
clinical trial
of newer treatments.
