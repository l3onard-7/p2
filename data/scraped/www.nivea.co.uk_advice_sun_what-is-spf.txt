Choosing the Right SPF for Your
Skin
Summary
FAQs
Sun
protect
ion is essential for helping to maintain healthy-looking
skin
and preventing long-term damage. Prolonged exposure to the
sun
can cause
sun
burn
, premature ageing, and increase the risk of
skin
damage.
Sun
screen plays a crucial role in shielding the
skin
from harmful
UV
radiation, and SPF is a key factor in choosing the right
protect
ion.
What is SPF?
What does SPF stand for?
The SPF on
sun
screen stands for
sun
protect
ion factor, a relative measure
men
t for the amount of time the
sun
screen will
protect
the
skin
from
ultraviolet (UV) rays
. The higher the SPF number, the higher the percentage of UVB rays it will block.
How does SPF work?
SPF is determined by measuring the time it takes for redness (erythema) to appear on un
protect
ed
skin
exposed to a specific dose of UV rays, compared with un
protect
ed
skin
. So, in theory, an SPF 30
sun
cream would last 30 times longer than the same exposure without
protect
ion.
In practice, however, it's a different story, as the duration of a
sun
cream's effectiveness can depend on a number of factors, such as the quantity applied, the UV index, and whether the
skin
is sweating or swimming. The SPF value should therefore be seen more as a guide, and reapplied regularly.
SPF Levels
The difference between SPF levels
The difference between SPF levels lies in the amount of UVB
protect
ion they offer.
SPF15 blocks approximately 93% UVB rays
SPF 30 blocks about 97% of UVB rays
SPF 50 blocks approximately 98% of UVB rays

How to apply SPF correctly
Applying
sun
screen correctly is essential to ensure maximum UV
protect
ion. Even the most effective
sun
screen won’t work if it isn’t applied properly.
1. Apply generously
Sun
screen should be applied generously to all uncovered areas. The amount of SPF needed varies by age:
Under 3 years:
Avoid exposing babies and young children to the
sun
at all costs by keeping them in the shade and using
protect
ive clothing, a hat,
sun
glasses and a parasol, as their
skin
is extremely delicate and more vulnerable to UV damage. For uncovered areas subject to indirect exposure, use a minimum of 5 to 10 ml for babies aged 6 months and over.
Children (3-5 years):
At least 10-15ml. For more information on choosing the right
sun
protect
ion for children, check
NIVEA
’s
sun
screen guide for children
.
Children (5-10 years):
Require at least 15-20ml for full coverage.
Adults and children over 10:
Need at least 30-40ml for the whole body.

2. Apply 15-30 minutes before
sun
exposure
This allows the
sun
screen to fully absorb and begin
protect
ing your
skin
.
3. Cover all exposed areas
Don’t forget areas like ears, neck, scalp (if exposed), back of hands and feet.
4. Use a dedicated face
sun
screen
When applying SPF to face, make sure to use a
sun
screen formulated for the face and
sensitive
skin
.
How Long Does SPF50 Last & How often should you reapply
sun
screen?
The effectiveness of a
sun
screen decreases over time, especially with exposure to water, sweat, or towel-drying. Additionally, the lower the SPF and the longer the time since application, the fewer UVB rays will be filtered.
Regardless of the SPF level used, to maintain optimal
protect
ion,
sun
screen should be reapplied every two hours. If you are swimming, sweating, or towel-drying, it will wear off more quickly, requiring more frequent reapplication. Always check the
sun
screen's water-resistant label for specific guidance on reapplication during water activities. Regular reapplication ensures continuous
protect
ion throughout the day.
What is SPF & How often should it be applied
Facts Overview
Application:
Sun
screen should be reapplied every two hours or more frequently if swimming or sweating.
What is SPF:
SPF stands for
Sun
Protect
ion Factor, indicating the level of
protect
ion
sun
screen provides against UVB rays.
SPF levels:
SPF15 blocks approximately 93% UVB rays
SPF 30 blocks approximately 97% of UVB rays.
SPF 50 blocks approximately 98% of UVB rays.
Protect
ion with SPF for Face and Body
Protect
ion with SPF for Face
Your face is highly exposed to UV rays, making daily SPF application essential to prevent
sun
damage and premature ageing. SPF 50 provides higher
protect
ion, though lower SPFs work during less intense exposure if applied and reapplied correctly.
Apply
sun
screen as the last step of your
skin
care
routine and before you apply any makeup, covering your face, neck, and upper torso. Using moisturisers with SPF offer a convenient way to add SPF into your routine..
Although many makeup products now contain SPF, they are generally not applied in sufficient quantities to offer adequate
protect
ion. It's therefore important to ensure you're still using a sufficient amount of
sun
screen for optimal
protect
ion.

Choosing the right SPF for your
skin
When selecting
sun
screen, it is important to choose an SPF level that suits your
skin
type, the environ
men
t, and the activity you're engaging in.
Fairer
skin
tones:
For fair
skin
tones, an SPF 50+ is recom
men
ded, as fair
skin
has lower
melanin
levels and is more prone to burning and
skin
damage.
Darker
skin
tones:
For darker
skin
tones, an SPF 30+ is usually sufficient, as melanin offers some
natural
UV defence. However, this does not eliminate the risk of
sun
burn, hyperpig
men
tation, or
skin
damage, so daily SPF application remains essential. In some cases, an SPF 50 may be recom
men
ded, particularly to
protect
the face in the event of high exposure or hyperpig
men
tation.
Oily
skin
:
For
oily
skin
, it is recom
men
ded to use a lightweight, mattifying
sun
screen that will not clog pores or feel greasy.
Sun
protect
ion products in fluid or gel form generally give a less oily effect than creams. Look for products with an ultra-light texture and ingredients such as Niacinamide to absorb the serum and help prevent imperfections.
Sensitive
skin
:
For
sensitive
skin
, choose
sun
creams specially formulated for this
skin
type and which have been dermatologically tested. Fragrance-free, ethyl alcohol-free, and for
sensitive
skin
options help minimise the risk of redness appearance and discomfort.
Dry
skin
:
Dry
skin
benefits from
hydra
ting
sun
screens enriched with ingredients like
Hyaluron
ic Acid, Glycerine, or Ceramides to lock in moisture while providing UV
protect
ion. Many SPF-infused moisturisers offer both
sun
protect
ion and
hydra
tion, preventing dryness and flaking caused by prolonged
sun
.
Should you choose SPF 50 or 30? What’s the difference?
The choice between SPF 30 or 50 will depend mainly on your
skin
type, the UV index and how long you plan to stay in the
sun
. Although in theory, SPF 50 blocks approximately 98% of UVB rays, as opposed to approximately 97% for SPF 30, the actual
protect
ion will depend on the quantity applied, the exposure time and the frequency of application.
Protect
ion levels above SPF 50 only offer marginally additional coverage, and no level of SPF
protect
ion can provide 100%
protect
ion. In most situations, SPF 30 is adequate
protect
ion if applied correctly and regularly; however, SPF 50 remains the safer option for fair
skin
or heavy exposure. For those seeking trusted
sun
protect
ion, try our
NIVEA
Sun
Protect
& Moisture SPF 50 Lotion

Summary
SPF measures how effectively
sun
screen
protect
s your
skin
from UVB rays. The higher the SPF, the more
protect
ion it offers, but reapplication every two hours is crucial for maintaining
sun
safety. Apply
sun
screen generously and evenly, and make sure to reapply after swimming or sweating for consistent
protect
ion.
Frequently Asked Questions
How much
sun
screen should I use?
You should apply about 35 ml or the equivalent of 7 teaspoons on all parts of the body, and make sure to reapply it every two hours.
Does SPF 100 offer double the
protect
ion of SPF 50?
No, SPF 100 only offers slightly more
protect
ion than SPF 50. SPF 50 blocks about 98% of UVB rays, while SPF 100 blocks around 99%. The most important thing is to apply a sufficient quantity and reapply regularly to maintain the level of
protect
ion.
Can I rely on
sun
screen alone for
protect
ion?
While
sun
screen is essential, it should be used alongside other
protect
ive measures like wearing hats,
sun
glasses,
protect
ive clothing and seeking shade, especially during peak
sun
hours.
How often should I reapply
sun
screen?
You should reapply
sun
screen every two hours, and more often if you are swimming, sweating, or towel drying.
Is
sun
screen safe for
sensitive
skin
?
Yes, many
sun
screens are formulated for
sensitive
skin
. Look for products labelled as “for
sensitive
skin
” or “dermatologist tested.” Ask for advice to your pharmacist if you have doubts.
What is the best SPF?
The best SPF notably depends on your
skin
type and activity level. SPF 30 to 50 is suitable for most daily activities, while SPF 50+ is recom
men
ded for fair
skin
and in case of extended outdoor exposure (don't forget to reapply regularly).
For
aqua
tic activities, choose a water-resistant SPF 50+ and reapply after swimming or toweling off.
Difference between SPF 30 and 50?
SPF 30 blocks approximately 97% of UVB rays, while SPF 50 blocks approximately 98%. However, these percentages are only indicative and may decrease significantly if insufficiently applied or depending on the activity.
SPF 50 offers a slight increase in
protect
ion, especially for those with fair
skin
or when the UV index is higher.
