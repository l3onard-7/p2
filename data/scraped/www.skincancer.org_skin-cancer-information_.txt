What You Need to Know About Cancers of the Skin
What Is Skin Cancer?
Skin cancer is the out-of-control growth of abnormal cells in the epidermis, the outermost skin layer, caused by unrepaired DNA damage that triggers mutations. These mutations lead the skin cells to multiply rapidly and form malignant tumors. The main types of skin cancer are basal cell carcinoma (BCC), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), melanoma and Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC).

What Does Skin Cancer Look Like?
Skin cancers can look quite different from one person to another due to skin tone, size and type of skin cancer and location on the body. See our Skin Cancer Pictures page for a selection of photos to help you understand what skin cancers can look like. View pictures.

What Causes Cancers of the Skin?
The two main causes of skin cancer are the sunâ€™s harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays and using UV tanning beds. The good news is that if skin cancer is caught early, your dermatologist can treat it with little or no scarring and high odds of eliminating it entirely. Often, the doctor may even detect the growth at a precancerous stage, before it has become a full-blown skin cancer or penetrated below the surface of the skin.
