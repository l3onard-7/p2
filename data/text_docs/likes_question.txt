prompt="Is Cryosurgery invasive?", response="Cryosurgery is a non-invasive technique, which means it does not involve cutting or inserting instruments into the body. It uses liquid nitrogen to  cool the targeted tissue to subzero temperatures, inducing tissue damage and  promoting healing by secondary intention. This process can take longer to  heal than an excision, especially if it is performed on the leg."
