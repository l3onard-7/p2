Is Cryosurgery invasive?,"Cryosurgery is a non-invasive technique, which means it does not involve cutting or inserting instruments into the body. It uses liquid nitrogen to  cool the targeted tissue to subzero temperatures, inducing tissue damage and  promoting healing by secondary intention. This process can take longer to  heal than an excision, especially if it is performed on the leg."
Is SCC an aggressive cancer?,"Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin is usually not life-threatening. But if it's not treated, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin can grow large or spread to other parts of the body. The growth of the cancer can cause serious complications."
Is SCC faster growing than Basal cell cancers,"Yes, Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) generally grows faster than Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC). While both are slow-growing compared to melanoma, SCCs are known for their faster growth rate and a greater tendency to invade deeper layers of skin. "
"After biopsy, my skin is red and itchy, what is the cause and what should I do?","Red and itchy skin after a biopsy can be caused by skin irritation, allergic reactions, or skin conditions such as lichen planus or psoriasis.
